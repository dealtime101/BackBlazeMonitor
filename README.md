# Backblaze Monitor

A small Windows tile that watches the **Backblaze** backup service (`bzserv`): status, real upload rate, history graph, remaining files, and an adjustable upload limit.

> **Unofficial tool**, not affiliated with Backblaze, Inc. "Backblaze" is a trademark of its owner. This tool only **reads** Backblaze's local logs and reports, and controls its Windows service.

## What it shows

- **Service status** (running, stopped, ...), with Start / Stop / Restart.
- **Current upload rate**, all threads combined (sum of the bytes completed over 2 minutes), in Mbps or MB/s (click to switch).
- **Graph** over 30 min, 24 h or 7 days (right-click), with a tooltip per time slice.
- **Remaining files and bytes**, with an estimated finish time; **progress per disk** (click the "Remaining" line).
- **Upload limit** by step, or by **time window** (for example 3 Mbps from 8 am to 10 pm), applied through a Windows QoS policy.
- **Alerts**: the service stopped without going through the tile, or nothing has been sent for a threshold while files are waiting.
- Notification-area icon, list of the last files sent, start at sign-in.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit).
- The **[.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)** (free, from Microsoft).
- The **Backblaze** backup client installed on the machine (it writes the logs and reports the tile reads).

## Installation

1. Download the zip from the [Releases](../../releases) page (or from the Downloads page of dealtimeworlds.com) and unzip it anywhere.
2. Double-click **`BackblazeMonitor.exe`**.

The exe is **not code-signed**, so on first launch Windows SmartScreen may show a blue "Windows protected your PC" box: click *More info* → *Run anyway*. If the zip was downloaded from the web, you can also right-click it → Properties → *Unblock* before unzipping.

## Administrator rights

Starting or stopping the service and setting a limit need administrator rights: Windows shows a **UAC prompt**. For the limit and time windows, the first prompt creates a SYSTEM scheduled task that handles the following ones without asking again. Nothing runs without that prompt.

## Files written

Next to the exe: `settings.txt` (preferences), `historique.txt` (15-minute slices of the last 7 days), `volumes.txt` (per-disk progress), and `error.log` if something goes wrong. They are specific to each machine; delete them to start from scratch.

## Build and test

Requires the .NET 8 SDK or later.

```powershell
dotnet test BackblazeMonitor.slnx
dotnet publish src/BackblazeMonitor/BackblazeMonitor.csproj -c Release -o publish
```

`publish/BackblazeMonitor.exe` is a single framework-dependent exe. The logic (log parsing, rates, history, schedules, command building) lives in `src/BackblazeMonitor.Core` and is covered by the unit tests; the Windows interface is in `src/BackblazeMonitor`.
